# minecraft-vol-surface-generator
A procedural implied volatility surface generator inspired by Minecraft terrain engines. Uses fractal noise (Perlin / fBM) to generate infinite structurally consistent volatility regimes for stress testing hedging strategies, IV arbitrage, and regime robustness beyond historical data.
